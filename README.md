# devops-pipeline-EndToEnd
ðŸš€ End-to-End DevOps Pipeline Project â€” A complete hands-on implementation of a modern CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Argo CD. The project automates infrastructure provisioning, containerized deployments, and continuous delivery workflows with integrated monitoring (ELK + Prometheus). Built from scratch.


**Complete DevOps Pipeline Project**

This project demonstrates a real-world, end-to-end DevOps pipeline built from scratch.
It covers every major stage of the CI/CD lifecycle â€” from code build and containerization to infrastructure automation and continuous delivery.

**Key Technologies**:

Docker: for building and managing container images

Terraform: for provisioning cloud infrastructure as code

Jenkins: for CI pipelines with multiple automated stages

Kubernetes: for orchestrating containerized applications

Argo CD: for GitOps-based continuous delivery

ELK Stack + Prometheus: for monitoring, observability, and log analytics


**Goal**: Create a portfolio-ready, fully automated DevOps system demonstrating professional skills in CI/CD, IaC, container orchestration, and monitoring.
